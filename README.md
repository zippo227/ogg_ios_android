# ogg_ios_android
git repository for libogg-1.3.2 and libvorbis-1.3.5. Added a VS2015 solution for compiling iOS static .a libraries and android .so libraries.

XIPH built the original source code I've adapted in this project; 
however, that in now implies that they have endorsed my additional solution files in any way.

I offer these additions under there exact same BSD terms. Hopefully someone from Xiph may find these useful and 
put them into the originl repositories.

Go to their original website for any documentation or help.
